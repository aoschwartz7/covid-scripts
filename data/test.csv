Sera from children seeking medical care was used, and therefore does not represent an unbiased population survey, it nonetheless represents the first large-scale SARS-CoV-2 serological survey of children. Serological assays can identify pediatric infections missed by the symptom-based administration of viral tests. The overall frequency of seropositivity was low (≈1%) even in April, suggesting that while infections of children are often missed by viral testing, perhaps due to the lack of symptoms, only a small fraction of children in Seattle had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 as of April 2020.","ELISA, Anti-SARS-CoV-2, IgG, Serum, Abbott, The study used a multi-assay serological testing approach based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) protocol and increased stringency by adding a second validation ELISA, 1.00 , 0.99 ;

Participation was restricted to 1 adult per household.","To estimate cumulative incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among adults in Los Angeles County, California.","The study data was used to estimate the population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The unweighted and weighted proportions of positive tests (either IgM or IgG) in the analysis sample were calculated. Because the sample differed on demographics and income distribution from Los Angeles County, weights were calculated to match the 2018 census on sex, race/ethnicity, and income. The weighted and unweighted proportion of positive results were adjusted for accuracy of the test. Confidence intervals for unweighted data were estimated using exact binomial models and for weighted and adjusted estimates using bootstrap methods.
